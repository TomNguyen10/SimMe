# SimMe - Personal Digital Twin via LLM Fine-tuning

SimMe is an innovative project that creates a digital representation of myself through fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on personal Facebook Messenger data. The goal is to create an AI that can replicate my communication style, personality traits, and response patterns in chat conversations.

## 🌟 Features

- Personalized chat AI based on real messenger data
- Fine-tuned LLM that captures individual communication patterns
- Support for both one-on-one and group chat contexts
- Context-aware response generation
- Modern web interface for interaction
- Privacy-focused data processing pipeline

## 🧠 Model Architecture & Training

### Data Processing Pipeline

The data pipeline (`data_pipelines.ipynb`) implements a sophisticated process for handling Facebook Messenger data:

1. **Data Extraction & Cleaning**:

   - Processes raw JSON exports from Facebook Messenger
   - Uses `ftfy` library for text encoding normalization
   - Handles multi-file message histories and participant information
   - Implements custom `Message` class for structured data representation

2. **Message Processing**:

   ```python
   class Message:
       def __init__(self, sender_name, receivers, content, timestamp_ms, chat_name):
           self.sender_name = sender_name
           self.receivers = receivers
           self.content = content
           self.timestamp_ms = timestamp_ms
           self.chat_name = chat_name
   ```

3. **Advanced Analysis**:

   - Natural Language Processing using NLTK
   - Sentiment analysis with TextBlob
   - Message pattern analysis
   - Temporal analysis of chat behaviors
   - Word frequency and n-gram analysis

4. **Privacy Protection**:
   - Sensitive information filtering
   - Personal data anonymization
   - Message content sanitization
   - Metadata preservation with PII removal

### Model Architecture & Fine-tuning

The model implementation (`model.ipynb`) utilizes state-of-the-art LLM techniques:

1. **Base Model**:

   - Uses Meta's Llama-3.1-8B as foundation
   - Implements custom tokenization with right-side padding
   - Optimized for chat-style interactions

2. **Document Processing**:

   ```python
   class Document:
       def to_text(self):
           result = "<<SYS>>Write a realistic text message chat. Avoid repetition.<</SYS>>\n"
           # Custom formatting for one-on-one vs group chats
           # Context-aware message structuring
   ```

3. **Training Configuration**:

   - Dynamic context window management
